# nosql-challenge

For this project, I used Mongo to build and analyze a database of businesses in the UK.
I was able to look up businesses based on location, type, customer rating, and more.

I utilized GitHub, Youtube, past assignments, cloud recordings, and a coder friend's assistance for this assignment.
